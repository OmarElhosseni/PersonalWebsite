      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h2>I am an Egyptian-born student who loves to learn, create, and grow. My first time using a computer was
      when I was living in Egypt and my father bought a computer
      so that my mother and I could video call him over the internet while he worked
      in America. Pretty much ever since then I've been obsessed with computers.</h2>
